# SchoolNest studenthome
## The idea
The idea here is to enable students to use a local editor (not linked with a teacher or a join code) to edit files on GitHub. This allows them to push and pull changes without much hassle, but only supports the main branch. (The `main` currently must be used, `master` branch is not allowed). Some clarifications to be made are that this isn't meant to be linked to a teacher or a classroom, and you can simply paste in the created github classroom repo to edit the files. This is meant as a replit alternative for students who need access to multiple projects. This replit alternative also contains git support which a student can use to host their code.


## Features
- ### git integration
    You can integrate projects with git by pressing the github icon. If a project is integrated, the github icon wil have a different color indicating so. You can change the github project link at any time, but you **cannot** and **cannot** reset your github token encryption. If you do, you will lose your personal access token.
- ### Advanced settings
    These settings will let you clear your files, update your disk, or delete github access tokens that aren't needed anymore. This will help your device free up space.
- ### Project creation
    Each project is linked with a github Repo. Specific enforcements are made to ensure that FileSystem data cannot be corrupted.
